# cppLearning_003

Learning C++ from `C++ Primer 5th edition` written by `Stanley B. Lippman`, `Jos√©e Lajoie`, and
`Barbara E. Moo`. (2013)

- C++11

To successfully configure and build the subfolders (exercise folders) that are depending on
the `cmake` build system, run either `getGoogleTest.ch` or `getGoogleTest.py` in this folder. 
This downloads the *googletest release version 1.12.1*. This specific version is because we are 
using C++11 concepts. Later versions of googletest require higher versions of C++.

- `googletest` folder is ignored for tracking.
- `ch09/ch09_exrc/checkDoxy` is the folder used for setting up the `cmake`, doxygen document generation and `googletest` environment.
- `ch09/ch09_exrc/checkDoxy/cmakeBuilder.py` can be used to *configure*, *build*, and *launch* the cmake targets. To trigger more targets of cmake, update the python file.
- For better organization, create a separate build directory and run CMake from within it to keep your source and build files distinct.
- Command to start the doxygen documentation: `make doc` or `cmake --build build --target doc`.
- Command to start testing: `make test` or `ctest` or `cmake --build build --target test`.
- Command to generate `CTest` based test report (which generates single report): `make testReports` or `cmake --build build --target testReports`
- Individual test suite reports are generated by googletest automatically when we run `ctest`. You can choose between `xml` and `json` format of output. Configure this variable: `REPORT_FORMAT`.
